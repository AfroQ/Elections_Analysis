# Variables

```python
# Creates a variable with a string "Frankfurter"
title = "Frankfurter"

# Creates a variable with an integer 80
years = 80

# Creates a variable with the boolean value of True
expert_status = True

# Prints a statement adding the variable
print("Nick is a professional " + title)

# Convert the integer years into a string and prints
print("He has been coding for " + str(years) + " years")

# Converts a boolean into a string and prints
print("Expert status: " + str(expert_status))

# An f-string accepts all data types without conversion
print(f"Expert status: {expert_status}")
```

# Lists

- Lists are very flexible, you can store so many different data types in them. 
- You extract the data by number (index) eg. grocery_list[3]

```
# Create a Python list to store your grocery list
grocery_list = ["milk", "Bread", "Eggs", "Peanut Butter", "Jelly"]

# Print the grocery list
print(grocery_list)

# Change "Peanut Butter" to "Almond Butter" and print out the updated list
grocery_list[3]= "Almond Butter"

# Remove "Jelly" from grocery list and print out the updated list
grocery_list.remove("Jelly")

# Add "Coffee" to grocery list and print the updated list
grocery_list.append("Coffee")
print(grocery_list)
```

# Dictionaries

Create a list of key value pairs

```python
```
