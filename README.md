#Total number of votes cast
<!-- 1. initialize variable to contain total votes
2. Loop through all rows, adding to total for very row

A complete list of candidates who received votes
1. count each unique candidate name

Total number of votes each candidate received
2. Initialize variable to hold total per candidate
3. For each unique candidate name, sum up every time they appear

Percentage of votes each candidate won
4. Each candidate total divide by total votes
5. format as percentage

The winner of the election based on popular vote
5. Compare all candidate totals
6. Get max count name -->



Using the election data, you will need to determine the total number of votes cast in the election. Using the code from the previous day, Tom will show you how to programmatically count up all the votes cast in the election by amending the code below the `for` loop.

Next, you will retrieve the names of the individual candidates in the election. This is important, because later you will need to determine how many votes each candidate received and their percentage of the total vote.
